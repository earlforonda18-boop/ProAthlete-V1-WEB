  <h5>10. DISPUTES, ADDITIONAL TERMS, APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION</h5>>
  <p>This Platform is a passive platform, solely based in Quebec, Canada, which does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over PRO ATHLETE in jurisdictions other than the Province of Quebec (Canada).</p>
  <p>You agree that the Platform, the Terms and the Privacy Policy (including the interpretation, the enforcement, the applicability, the validity and the effects of the Terms and of the Privacy Policy), and any litigation between you and 
    PRO ATHLETE shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the Province of Quebec and the laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to (i) private international law principles, (ii) choice of law provisions, (iii) any conflict 
    of laws rule or principle, foreign or domestic, which might refer such interpretation to the laws of another jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <p>You agree that all disputes, claims and legal proceedings directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Platform (including but not limited to the purchase of PRO ATHLETE products), the Terms and the Privacy Policy shall be resolved 
    individually, without resort to any form of class action.
  </p>
  <p>You agree that all disputes, claims and legal proceedings directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Platform (including but not limited to the purchase of PRO ATHLETE products), the Terms and the Privacy Policy shall be submitted 
    to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Judicial District of Quebec City, in the Province of Quebec (Canada), to the exclusion of any other jurisdiction that may otherwise be competent under the provisions of the law.
  </p>
  <p>Without limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Platform, the Terms and the Privacy Policy, nor to any litigation, claim or 
    proceeding arising therefrom.
  </p>
  <p>You hereby waive all defenses of “lack of personal jurisdiction” and “inconvenient forum” with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the Judicial District of Montreal, in the Province of Quebec (Canada).</p>
  <p>All claims shall be brought within one (1) year after the claim arises, except to the extent a longer period is required by applicable law.</p>

  <h5>11. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS</h5>>
  <p>By using the Platform, you agree to receive certain electronic communications from PRO ATHLETE.</p>
  <p>You agree that any notice, agreement, disclosure or other communication that PRO ATHLETE sends you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</p>

  <h5>12. RIGHT TO ASSIGN, NO WAIVERS, SEVERABILITY</h5>>
  <p>PRO ATHLETE may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without notice</p>
  <p>Any failure or delay by PRO ATHLETE to exercise a right, remedy or privilege hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such right, remedy or privilege. Likewise, the fact that PRO ATHLETE failed to exercise a right, remedy or privilege shall 
    not prevent PRO ATHLETE from exercising all or part of such right, remedy or privilege in the future. PRO ATHLETE's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of these Terms is not a waiver of any of these Terms or PRO ATHLETE's rights. 
    Users should always assume these Terms apply.
  </p>
  <p>If any provision hereof shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the validity of the other provisions of the Agreement.</p>
