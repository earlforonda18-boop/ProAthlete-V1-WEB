intro: "Basketball-Specific Injury Prevention and Performance Training Program"
description: >
  Our basketball training program is built to prepare your body for the unique demands of the sport. PRO ATHLETE's training programs are designed 
  by sports medicine and basketball performance experts to help reduce the risk of ACL tears, ankle sprains, overuse injuries and more, during play. 
  Basketball demands quick cuts, explosive jumps, and constant impact, putting serious stress on the body, which is why our programs not only include exercises 
  to improve strength and athletic abilities, but also incorporate neuromuscular exercises which are proven to reduce the risk of injury.
